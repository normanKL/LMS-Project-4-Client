## Future Improvements & Bugs
This is a basic licensing portal that can be developed in just over a week. However, to make it a fully functional and valuable tool, several improvements and additional features are needed:
* Expanded Product Coverage: Currently, the portal only tracks licensing status for Life Insurance and Takaful, including exam information. In practice, licensing is also required for additional wealth management products, such as unit trusts and more complex financial offerings.
* Product Certification Integration: Beyond licensing, specialists must be product-certified before engaging with clients. This portal should include product certification tracking and be integrated with other systems, such as underwriting and system access management.
* Streamlined Specialist Onboarding: The current process places an additional burden on licensing specialists. Ideally, new specialists should receive an automated email with a link to complete forms and upload required documents, such as certificates, directly through the portal.

After several rounds of testing, no bugs have been identified in this version of the portal.
